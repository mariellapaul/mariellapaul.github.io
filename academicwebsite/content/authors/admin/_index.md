I am a PhD student in Neuropsychology with Angela D. Friederici at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (MPI-CBS) in collaboration with the Berlin School of Mind and Brain. My research interests include the neural underpinnings of language acqusition during early childhood, with a growing interest in meta research and open science. As an eLife Community ambassador and a member of the local Open Science initiative at MPI-CBS, I promote the use of Open Science practices in everyday research.
