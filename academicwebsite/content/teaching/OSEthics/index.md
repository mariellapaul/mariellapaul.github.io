"Harry Potter and the Methods of Reproducibility -- A brief Introduction to Open Science" is the title of a talk I gave on a lecture on January 23, 2020 as part of Vincent Cheung's course "Planning and Conducting a Psychology Experiment". The talk gives a brief overview of Open Science, particularly reproducibility. It introduces the concept of questionable research practices (QRPs) and Open Science solutions to these QRPs, such as preregistrations, registered reports, Open Data, Open Code, and Open Materials. It also outlines how these practices relate to research ethics. The lecture is approachable and interactive and has a Harry-Potter theme throughout.
